KeyLock

KeyLock is a program to try to help physically handicapped persons to use a PC.
For someone who can only hit one key at a time, key sequences like control-C or
alt-F1 or ctrl-alt-delete become impossible.  This program changes the ctrl,
alt, and the left shift keys into locking keys, much like the num lock or caps
lock keys.  The program is run as follows:

Keylock/option      (no space before slash!)

no option   Brings up a little help and explanation screen.  Nothing else
/I /i        Install KeyLock
/S /s        Put KeyLock to sleep - keyboard works normally again
/W /w        Wake KeyLock back up - keys are now locks again

any other options or options entered at the wrong time (like /s with no /i
beforehand) will bring up the same help screen.


To change the keys used as locks, 2 areas of the program must be changed:

1. The label "numkeys" must reflect the number of keys handled by the program -
currently 3, for ctrl, alt, and left-shift.

2. The table "scancodes" must contain the scancodes for the keys to be recognized
as locks.  Also, this table must always follow table "keyflags" in memory, or
other logic must also be changed.

Feel free to use and distribute this program, and please send any suggestions
or changes to me on the Telstar BBS in San Antonio (512) 822-8882 or:
